        <p>Hi I am Emree and I am a graphic design major. I love working out and watching movies with my husband.We just got married at the begining of this month. I don't have a job currently but I am hoping to become a fitness instructor after this semester.the thing I love most about BYU Idhao is the spiritual enviroment that it brings. I think that the things that I learn about in this class will help me in my future career as a graphic designer. I am excited to learn more about web design with all of you.</p>
