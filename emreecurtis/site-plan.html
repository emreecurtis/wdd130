        Emree Curtis, age 22

        Hi my name Emree Curtis and I am currently a student at Brigham Young University of Idaho. I am studying a bachelors in Art with an emphasis in graphic design. I am very familiar with designing programs like Adobe Illustrator, Indesign, Photoshop, and Lightroom. Photography is another art that I am familiar with from 3 years in high school and 1 semester in college. I hope to take both of these art forms and use them further in my career.

      <h3>[Portfolio]</h3>
      <p>
        When I was growing up I always loved to create art. I mostly made drawings/paintings but when I started middle school I started getting interested in photography. I started out with just taking pictures on my phone and then transitioned to DSLR cameras in High school when I was taking photo classes. My love for Photoshop grew and I realized that I wanted to work with more programs like it, so when I went into college I decided studying graphic design would be the right path for me and I have loved it ever since.
        
        Here are a few examples of my graphic design work and photography.
        
        Graphic Design
        
        
        PSA Ad Poster- For this project I was asked to make a poster sharing the danger of pollution in the ocean. I created a turtle completely made of trash bags that I drew. I created most of this poster in Photoshop and finished it off with text in Illustrator.
         
        
        Business Card- For this project we were asked to design a business card consisting of 3 colors and 2 types of text fonts. I created a logo or watermark of sometype to add interest to the card and to be able to create a design pattern on the back. I was able to create this whole business card in Illustrator. 
        
        
        LDS Talk Pamphlet Design- For this project I was required to reconstruct an LDS General Conference talk into a new design layout. I learned a lot more about indesign through this project and using grids to organize the material for my design. Also I was able to understand and learn which fonts and colors look best together.
        
        Photography
        
        When it comes to photography I enjoy finding interesting and beautiful landscapes or places to capture in different ways to make them look unique. I also have had experiences taking photographs of people and editing those pictures to make them stand out from plain portraits.
