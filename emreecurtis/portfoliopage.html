                <p>When I was growing up I always loved to create art. I mostly made drawings/paintings
                 but when I started middle school I became interested in photography. I started out with
                 just taking pictures on my phone and then transitioned to DSLR cameras in high school. My
                 love for Photoshop grew and I realized that I wanted to work with more programs like it. When I went
                 to college I decided studying graphic design would be the right path for me and I have loved it ever since.

                <p>PSA Ad Poster- For this project I was asked to make a poster sharing the dangers of 
                 pollution in the ocean. I created a turtle completely made of trash bags that I drew. I
                 created most of this poster in Photoshop and finished it off with text in Illustrator.

                <p>Business Card- For this project we were asked to design a business card consisting of 
                 3 colors and 2 types of text fonts. I created a logo or watermark of some type to add interest
                 to the card and to be able to create a design pattern on the back. I was able to create this
                 whole business card in Illustrator.

                <p>LDS Talk Pamphlet Design- For this project I was required to reconstruct an LDS
                 General Conference talk into a new design layout. I learned a lot more about Indesign
                 through this project and using grids to organize the material for my design. Also I was
                 able to understand and learn which fonts and colors look best together.
