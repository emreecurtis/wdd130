                <p>When I was growing up I always loved to create art. I mostly made<br>drawings/paintings
                 but when I started middle school I became interested<br>in photography. I started out with
                 just taking pictures on my phone<br>and then transitioned to DSLR cameras in high school. My
                 love for Photoshop<br>grew and I relized that I wanted to work with more programs like it.<br>When I went
                 to college I decided studying graphic design would be<br>the right path for me and I have loved it ever since.

                <p>PSA Ad Poster- For this project I was asked<br>to make a poster shariing the dangers of<br>
                 pollution in the ocean. I created a turtle completely<br>made of trash bags that I drew. I
                 created<br>most of this posteer in Photoshop and<br>finished it off with text in Illustrator.

                <p>Business Card- For this project we were<br>asked to design a business card consisting of<br>
                 3 colors and 2 types of text fonts. I created a<br>logo or watermark of sometype to add interest<br>
                 to the card and to be able to create a design<br>pattern on the back. I was able to create this<br>
                 whole busineess card in Illustrator.

                 General Conference talk into a new design<br>layout. I learned a lot more about Indesign<br>
                 through this project and using grids to organize<br>the material for my design. Also I was
                 able to<br>understand and learn which fonts and colors<br>look best together.
